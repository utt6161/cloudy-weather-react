# cloudy-weather-react

my silly attempt to write something with react.
right now its just a frontend for a weather.
api was generously provided by weatherapi.
no routing for now, will add that later (12.05.2021 3:10am atm) as a separate branch (why not)

current issues: 
 * component switching is a mess
 * due to point above i can properly animate stuff, even with third-party libs
 * overall dEsIgN is crap. i'll have to think of something else.
 * somehow heroku says to me "go fuck urself bud" and refuses to do network calls
